# Space_x_falcon9
predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.
This project is my first project for my Data Science class at "dataroad" by Mona Hatami(https://github.com/monahatami1).I chose this dataset because I'm a big fan of Elon Musk.
For my project in this course.i will choose SpaceX dataset to clean,investigate and analyze.
